## Description 

This landing page was a way to refresh my memory on how to build a simple page from scratch. For a year and a half my work was focused on designining websites in Adobe XD and then using website builders like Elementor for Wordpress or Shopify to build them. Here's how I started:  

- Git, GitHub, and command-line basics to collaborate with other developers.
- Leverage Node.js tools like NPM and webpack to automate tasks.
- Enhance CSS techniques with BEM & PostCSS to keep my styles organized and manageable even on larger sites.
- Speed up my sites with the mobile-first performance philosophy.
- Go over JavaScript basics like Object-oriented Programming, and how to write well-structured code using the ES6 module pattern (Babel & webpack).
